You've seen what a class looks like and how to instantiate an object. Now it's your turn to write code that insantiates a shirt object.

# Explanation of the Code
This Jupyter notebook is inside of a folder called 1.OOP_syntax_shirt_practice. You can see the folder if you click on the "Jupyter" logo above the notebook. Inside the folder are three files:
- shirt_exercise.ipynb, which is the file you are currently looking at
- answer.py containing answers to the exercise
- tests.py, tests for checking your code - you can run these tests using the last code cell at the bottom of this notebook
