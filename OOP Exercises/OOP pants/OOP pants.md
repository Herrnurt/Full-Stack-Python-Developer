# OOP Syntax Exercise - Part 2

Now that you've had some practice instantiating objects, it's time to write your own class from scratch. This lesson has two parts. In the first part, you'll write a Pants class. This class is similar to the shirt class with a couple of changes. Then you'll practice instantiating Pants objects

In the second part, you'll write another class called SalesPerson. You'll also instantiate objects for the SalesPerson.

For this exercise, you can do all of your work in this Jupyter notebook. You will not need to import the class because all of your code will be in this Jupyter notebook.




# Pants class

Write a Pants class with the following characteristics:
* the class name should be Pants
* the class attributes should include
 * color
 * waist_size
 * length
 * price
* the class should have an init function that initializes all of the attributes
* the class should have two methods
 * change_price() a method to change the price attribute
 * discount() to calculate a discount
